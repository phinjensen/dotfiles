my dotfiles
===========

This repo contains the configuration files that I use on my Arch Linux installations. In theory, it should be able to transfer over to other OSes without too much of an issue, but I've primarily written it for Arch. To set everything up, just run:

bash install-linux.sh

and follow the prompts.

Firefox
=======

Firefox has some annoying settings that don't get synced (my normal way of updating my installation), like those that have to get changed in `about:config`. Those that need to be changed:

  ui.key.menuAccessKeyFocuses: false
  browser.tabs.firefox-view: false
  browser.compactmode.show: true

Also, customize the toolbar to remove Pocket, Firefox account, and buffer areas around address bar.

TODO
====

I'm trying Fedora Workstation on my laptop now. A new script will need to be written for automated installation, and some things will undoubtedly be different (e.g. xinitrc).

- Do TSInstall for all relevant treesitterlanguages
  :TSInstall c cpp css lua html java javascript json python rust
- Install language servers for relevant languages
  - JS/TS
  - Python
  - Rust
  - C/C++
  - Java
- clone with `git submodule update --init`
